# Getting Started

# Installing Forge

1 Run normal Minecraft 1.8.9 and once it reaches the title screen wait about 5 seconds and close it.

2 Install Minecraft 1.8.9 forge from the forge website

3 Once you click on the installer you'd like to download, a window will pop up. Do not click on anything in the middle of your screen; instead, click on the skip ad button towards the top right

4 Open the installer, select install client, and click install

5 When forge is installed, open the Minecraft launcher, go under the installations tab, click new installation, select the version release 1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.xxxx (it will usually be all the way towards the 
bottom).

7 Once you are done, run this new installation that you just created. Once it reaches the title screen, wait about 5 seconds and close it.

# Installing the CrimsonIsleExtras mod

1 Download the latest mod [release](https://github.com/CreeperWarrior08/Crimson-Isle-Extras/releases). If it says this file may harm your computer, click allow anyways as all java files will be flagged by Chrome.

2 Add the NEU mod:

- press the windows key + R; type %appdata%; click on the folder called .minecraft; click on the folder called mods and drag the mods file in here.

3 Open the Minecraft launcher and run your forge installation you set up earlier.

4 Then, hop onto Skyblock and run the command /api new. Your api key is automatically filled out and all features should work.

5 Type /CIE. If you see the CrimsonIsleExtras menu, you have done this correctly!
